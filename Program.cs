            //IEnumerable means they are countable and and we can work our way through them in some sequence
            //It does not return a new list. What returns is a IEnumerable which talks like the list, walks like the list, so we can just treated like a list
            //
            //
            // var newScores = scores.Select(value => value * 2);// this in other programming languages can be Map or Reduce to transform data which is the same as a select
            //we are now to change the name of the variable we are passing in to the function expression from value to score
            var newScores = scores.Select(score => score * 2);
            var slightlyBetterDoubleScores = newScores.Select(score => score + 1);// as long as that transform works in Integers, we can use it to transform it any way we like
            //So the statement above will read: newScores is going to be the old scores projected/selected/transformed by taking each score and multiplying it by 2
            //

            //Small differences between an IEnumerable and a List
