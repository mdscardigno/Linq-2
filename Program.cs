            //Function expressions seem like they can behave like methods

            //We will see this concept in JS
            //This is a feature from Functional Programming/Languages
            //Functional languages treat code as if they were variables and can be passed around as if they were an Integer, Object, Boolean or String
            //We are treating code like data
            //MultiplyingByTwo is a local variable
            //Of Type Func<int, int>

            //Here is our handy multiply by two function
            // Func<int, int> MultiplyByTwo = value => value * 2;
            //NOTE: If you create a variable one time and you use it in only one place, we replace what it does with the name
            // so in the case of the function expression above, we can take value => value * 2 and replace MultiplyByTwo with what it does or the expression itself
            //see bellow on newScores variable
            // //OLD WAY
            // //Make a new list to store the results 
            // var newScores = new List<int>();

            // //Go through each score in the scores list
            // foreach (var score in scores)
            // {
            //     //use the 'MultiplyByTwo' function expression to take the score and double it
            //     var doubled = MultiplyByTwo(score);
            //     //add it to the new list 
            //     newScores.Add(doubled);

            //Another example of using a function expression
            // Func<Employee, string, bool> EmployeeHasName = (employee, name) == EmployeeHasName.Name == name;

            //LINQ METHODS:
            // SELECT
            //NEW WAY - LINQ
            //IEnumerable means they are countable and and we can work our way through them in some sequence
            //It does not return a new list. What returns is a IEnumerable which talks like the list, walks like the list, so we can just treated like a list
            //
            //
            // var newScores = scores.Select(value => value * 2);// this in other programming languages can be Map or Reduce to transform data which is the same as a select
            //we are now to change the name of the variable we are passing in to the function expression from value to score
            var newScores = scores.Select(score => score * 2);
            //So the statement above will read: newScores is going to be the old scores projected/selected/transformed by taking each score and multiplying it by 2
            //
            foreach (var score in newScores)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(score);
            }
            //Small differences between an IEnumerable and a List
            Console.WriteLine(scores.Count); //We can use Count() on a List 
            Console.WriteLine(newScores.Count());//once we have an IEnumerable Count becomes a method and not longer a property

            // Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", newScores));
